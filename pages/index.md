# Our Vision 

The internet has become a worrying place,
where companies secretly spy on your private business,
and sell your personal data.

My-Loop is a better way: we replace 
covert surveillance with honest partnership, 
making user-control an asset not an inconvenience.

My-Loop provides transparency and an ethical approach 
to using profiling and customer data in 
advertising, marketing, and sales.

# Our objectives

1. Personal Control: 
The public should have control over their personal data.
GDPR will soon make this a legal requirement in the UK and
EU with serious financial penalties. 
However implementing GDPR compliant sales & marketing is a challenge.

2. Simplicity: 
Provide a simple, effortless and safe way for the general public to see, share and monetise their personal data

3. Value: To harness the value of quality data for business.

4. Transparency: Bring data capture and usage out of
the dark.

5. Quality: helping organisations access a greater quantity and quality of data, while complying with GDPR legal rules.

## How it Works

### For Business

Upload data into My-Loop

Access via our simple API

Connect to the GDPR actions API to stay compliant


Monetise your data

Positive experience

My-Loop creates a positive online experience where consumers can take back control and fund real social impact. In addition it breathes new life into brand engagement online as low-value banner space is transformed into high-value targeted video advertising. Directly empowering the public increases trust and circumvents a common issue with privacy solutions by leaving the definition of acceptable intrusion to the creator. My-Loop seeks not to end the use of personal data for commercial means but to make it more effective and respectful, while helping regulate, inform, and educate

### For Individuals

1. Your My Loop profile
My-Loop collects data about you from various sources, and organises it into a profile. This is your profile -- you can access and control this data through the secure My Loop web-app. Explore what your digital profile reveals about you. Choose what data is private, and what can be used and by whom. Decide what charities you want to support.
