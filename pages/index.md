# Our Vision 

The internet has become a worrying place,
where companies secretly spy on your private business,
and sell your personal data.

My-Loop is a better way: we replace 
covert surveillance with honest partnership, 
making user-control an asset not an inconvenience.

My-Loop will allow users to control how their data is used by third-party researchers and marketers.  Allowing for more transparency and an ethical approach to marketing/advertising.
