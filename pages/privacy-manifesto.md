# Privacy Manifesto

Version: 1.0

## It is Your Data

Our ethos is: If the data is about you, then you should have control, and you should benefit.

We will provide you with the support and tools to make this meaningful and easy.

## We will respect and protect your privacy

We promise:

 - Your messages and other private content belong to you.
 - We will never sell or share your private information with a third party without your agreement (unless we are required to do so by law).
 - None of our staff will look at your private information, unless it's to fix an issue in the system. 
Our staff all sign non-disclosure agreements.
 - You can delete your data from our systems (unless we are required to keep it by law or for audit purposes).
 - You can change your mind later, and alter the permissions around your data.

In using My-Loop services, you agree:

 - You authorise us to store information relating to you, including the use of browser cookies. 
 Of course, you can change your mind about this.
 - Internal data use is OK. We can use your data in our internal systems. For example:
   - Our AI can learn from your data.
   - We can use your data to pick content to show you.
 - Provided we take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of your data,
 we can use your data in 3rd party systems. For example, the data might be 
 encrypted, anonymised, hashed, or otherwise protected.
 - We can contact you as part of the services we supply, e.g. to tell you about new features or any issues.
 - If you submit content to a public part of the site then you grant us an open licence to use, reproduce, adapt and publish that content. 
 An example would be posting a public comment on a blog we host. This does not affect private content, which remains private.
 
We will ask you to authorise access to sites such as Twitter using a secure system called OAuth. 
This means you don't have to give us your password. You can revoke OAuth access at any point. 
E.g. for Twitter, you do that at http://twitter.com/account/connections.
